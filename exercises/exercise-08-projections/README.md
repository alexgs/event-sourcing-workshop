# Exercise 8

For the exercises dealing with projections (so exercises 8, 9, and 10), I'm
just going to use Oskar's setup rather than continuing to pull mine forward.
It's just more expedient, as these exercises don't seem to build on the
cumulative solution that we arrived at in exercise 7.

* **2023-08-17:** I'm leaving this exercise only partially complete. I think I've learned the important lessons from this exercise and the rest is just grinding out the different event types, cases, and business logic. I can come back to this if I feel it might be helpful, but for now, I'm going to move on.
