# Exercise 9

This one is basically a repeat of exercise 8, but with the added trick that
you've got to check the stream number and make sure you don't apply the same
event twice. It seems pretty straightforward, so I'm going to skip it for now.

Can you tell I'm getting a little impatient with doing all of these exercises
in detail? ðŸ˜’
