# Exercise 10

I think this would be a worthwhile exercise, but [Oskar's own advice for handling eventual consistency][1] "is to work closely with the business and designers." It's not clear to me how to handle eventual consistency in this somewhat contrived example. I don't even see anything in the tests that would introduce eventual consistency (such as a `setTimeout` call).

I may come back to this in the future (especially if I struggle with eventual consistency), but I'm skipping it for now.
